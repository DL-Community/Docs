# Achievements

?> **[For PC Version]** In the achievements page, clicking on the number of achievements at the top enables the filtering mode to only display completed achievements.

## General Achievements

### Level completion achievements

This achievement is available for each level, and it can be unlocked by completing (100%) the corresponding level.

### Level collections achievements

In addition to completion achievements, most levels (except for those that do not include crowns or diamonds) also include two collection achievements: collecting all diamonds (10 diamonds) and collecting all crowns (3 crowns).

  * Collect All Diamonds

    * In most cases, collecting all 10 diamonds in a level requires completing it **in one go** without using any revives, as reviving will cause you to **lose all diamonds collected up to that point**.


  * Collect All Crowns

    * Similar to diamond collection, but reviving at any checkpoint (crowns, hearts) **will not** cause you to lose all crowns collected up to that point. Instead, it will cause you to **lose the most recently collected crown**.

## Special Achievements

### Hidden Achievements

  * Some levels also contain hidden achievements that can only be unlocked under certain conditions.

### Level-Specific Achievements

  * These achievements refer to achievements that are **not** part of the regular collection achievements and are not the level-specific hidden achievements. Currently, there are no such achievements in the game. Please stay tuned for future updates.
