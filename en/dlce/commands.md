## Arguments usage method

Create a shortcut for "DancingLine.exe", right click the shortcut and choose `Properties`, and your command arguments at the end of `Target`

### Example

`Target: "C:\DancingLine\Dancing Line.exe" -always_show_cursor -disable_discord_rpc`

**Format: **`"game exe file path" -argument1 -argument2 -argument3...`

?> There should be a space after the game exe file path, otherwise the command will not take effect. You can add multiple arguments at the same time, note that there **must also be a space between each argument**.
